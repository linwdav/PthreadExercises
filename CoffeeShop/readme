coffeeshop.c should be compiled with c99 and lpthread.  It will throw the following warning:

coffeeshop.c: In function ‘doWork’:
coffeeshop.c:119: warning: implicit declaration of function ‘usleep’

A possible explanation is that "POSIX.1-2008 removes the specification of usleep()".
Despite this warning, the program worked correctly on my machine.

Another note: The program will take a few minutes to run.
